### Hey, I'm Necloremius (he/him), a 14 year old software developer! ðŸ‘‹

âžµ I'm quite proficient at Python and am exploring the vast world of ML/AI right now :) (Done stuff w/ Rust, Elixir, Java, C++, and JS but not enough to call myself proficient by any standards)

âžµ If you want to contact me, message me on Discord @Necloremius#5056



âžµ I'm beginning to write Medium articles, so go check those out @https://neclo.hashnode.dev/, and feel free to subscribe to me!
