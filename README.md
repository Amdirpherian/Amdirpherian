### Hey, I'm Necloremius (he/him), a 14 year old software developer! ðŸ‘‹


I'm great at Python and am tackling Elixir and Rust right now! I know quite 4-5 other languages as well, but not well enough to brag about here :p

----
I love programming, playing tennis, pondering calculus problems, listening to music, and drinking bubble tea!
