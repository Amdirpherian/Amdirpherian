### Hey, I'm Necloremius (he/him), a 14 year old software developer! ðŸ‘‹


I'm quite proficient at Python and am exploring the vast world of ML/AI right now, and know various other languages, though not as proficiently.

----
I love programming, playing tennis, pondering calculus problems, listening to music, and drinking bubble tea!
